# PMATCH
# Recursive File-Hasher and String-Matcher


This is designed to do 3 things;

1. Given an input hash/list of hashes in a text file, scan the host for matching files.
2. Given a list of input strings/string, scan files for percentage matches with the given list.
3. Check 'Magic Number' of given file and compare against current extension to determine mis-matches (I.E. - if a .exe file has been labeled as a .gif, etc)
